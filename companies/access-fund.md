Soloing is a dangerous game. One mistake—one slip-up—and you’re dead. Most climbers will never solo. Those who do have taken a very deliberate, intentional step. Once they reach the top of the wall or get back down to the ground, they can choose to never risk their life again.

Some of us don’t have that choice. Some of us are always soloing. One mistake—one slip up— and we’re dead. The wrong door knocked on to get help after an accident. The wrong woman confronted in the park about her off-leash dog. The wrong body, the wrong skin color, to be given a chance to breathe by a police officer who is supposed to be there to keep us safe.

Black and Brown folks are always soloing. There is no spring-loaded camming device of privilege to make sure we are safe when we are pulled over for going 10 over the speed limit. There is no benefit of the doubt when we are subjected to stop and frisk. We have to send. We have to be perfect. And sometimes, even when we do everything right, a hold breaks, and there is another dead Black or Brown person in the street.

Access Fund’s mission is to keep climbing areas open and protect the climbing environment. The death of George Floyd, and systemic racism in our country, specifically anti-Black racism and oppression, is an access issue. If you do not even feel safe on the sidewalk out front of your house—if you do not even feel safe in your own home—how could you possibly feel safe going out to the crag, let alone pulling a crux way off the deck? Even if the gate to the crag is open, can someone who feels fear for their life simply because they’ve stepped outside truly be said to have access to our climbing areas?
