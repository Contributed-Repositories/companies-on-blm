<h1>AmerisourceBergen</h1>

<p>&quot;Peace is not just the absence of conflict; peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, colour, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference. &quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nelson Mandela</li>
</ul>
<p>Like every individual, I view the world through the lens of my experiences. That lens for me is tinted by my formative years in South Africa, my experience coming to the United States of America as an outsider as well as the privilege that’s been afforded to me by the color of my skin.</p>
<p>As the United States grapples with a legacy of social injustice – horrifically punctuated with the recent killings of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery among many others – I am reminded of Nelson Mandela’s words on peace. Mandela, one of my heroes as a native South African, spoke in India in 2004 and called out what so many of us in positions of privilege in the United States are increasingly confronting. That a country where people of color do not and cannot feel safe is not a country at peace. The United States has made progress in our lifetime, but remains in everyday conflict over the fundamental right of equality. It is the responsibility of institutions and individuals with power to support the side of justice in this struggle.</p>
<p>AmerisourceBergen is guided by our purpose and principles, and unity in our responsibility to create healthier futures necessitates action to address and attack systematic inequality. Our company and our foundation provide meaningful support to non-profit organizations that fight for justice and work to strengthen communities who feel the impact of oppression and discrimination. Earlier today, we shared with our associates that their donations to the Equal Justice Initiative and other organizations will be matched on a 2 to 1 basis.</p>
<p>To our associates in the black community, while it would be impossible to say that I understand the emotions you’re feeling, I can say that I, along with AmerisourceBergen, stand with you and are at the ready to confront oppression. Your lives matter.</p>
<p>We support all AmerisourceBergen associates who are grappling to address their environment now. We are actively communicating with our associates and ensuring everyone has access to resources and assistance including support for mental health and crisis preparedness.</p>
<p>Much of the past few weeks has been spent executing on our fundamental role in confronting a global pandemic. Through this global health crisis our organization, on the backs of every one of our 22,000 associates, has persevered and remained hopeful for a return to normal. The unacceptable truth that we must confront and work to overcome is that many people, for no other reason than the color of their skin, do not have a normal to return to.</p>
<p>This absence of safety and equity has simmered for far too long and now after myriad examples of violence against communities of color, peaceful protests have in many cases boiled into destruction on the streets of many cities across the United States and the globe. I know that health care providers that our company supports, many of whom care for vulnerable populations, have been impacted and my sincere hope is that the current violence and unrest can quickly be replaced by acceleration of action and progress towards meaningful equity.</p>
<p>To achieve this progress, each of us must live up to our responsibility to work towards true peace. A peace, as Mandela defines, where all can flourish regardless of our beautiful differences.</p>
