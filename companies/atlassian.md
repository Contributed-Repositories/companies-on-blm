      "The standard you walk past is the standard you accept." - General David John Hurley, Governor-General of Australia
      Atlassian cares deeply about supporting our team, our communities, our planet and our customers. We aren’t perfect, but we are making progress and sharing our journey in our annual Sustainability report.
      We know we have more work to do. As we look to our future, we must think about what stronger leadership for racial justice looks like. It’s not just about creating a diverse Atlassian team. But, this is a start. And we definitely need to do more to hire and retain underrepresented minorities. Which is why we’re committed to being open about where we can improve and where we’re making progress.
