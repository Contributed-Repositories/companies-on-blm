<h1>Berkshire Hathaway</h1>

<p>It is crucial for us to stand in solidarity with our families, friends, clients and colleagues to fight the ongoing systemic racism within our own community and the world. On behalf of the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Toronto Realty leadership team, we are making an ongoing commitment to educate ourselves and those in our communities on how to be a better ally and make real changes, and vocalizing support more often. By having difficult conversations, speaking up and challenging the systems we have normalized, and loudly showing support for those who need it most, our actions can dictate the future.</p>
<p>Protests are currently being held across the globe to end systemic racism and violence against the Black community. Support for the movement can take many forms, including participating in demonstrations, having conversations with peers about racism and privilege, contributing monetary donations and more.</p>
<p>While there are many black-led international funds and USA based charities that have gained traction, there are numerous groups in Toronto and the GTA that are accepting donations to support our local communities. If you are able to, we encourage you to donate to the following local charities, organizations and advocacy groups dedicated to supporting Black members of our community during this difficult time:</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter- Toronto – Black Lives Matter – Toronto Chapter</p>
<p>BLAC (Black Legal Action Centre) – A non-profit community legal clinic that provides free legal services for low or no income Black residents of Ontario.</p>
<p>Black Youth Helpline – Black Youth Helpline serves all youth and specifically responds to the need for a Black youth specific service, positioned and resourced to promote access to professional, culturally appropriate support for youth, families and schools.</p>
<p>CEE (Careers, Education, Empowerment) Centre for Young Black Professionals – A charity dedicated to addressing economic and social barriers affecting black youth ages 14 and over.</p>
<p>In addition to donations, purchasing from black-owned businesses is a useful way to support locally. If you’re looking for Black-owned businesses to support, afrobiz and the Black Canada Biz Directory are great resources, containing extensive directories of Black businesses and services that include restaurants, legal services, shops, auto services, artists and more.</p>
