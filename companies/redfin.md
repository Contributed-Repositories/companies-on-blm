"Industry-wide studies in 2018 and 2019 show that white people get much better real estate service than Black people with the same finances. That difference perpetuates segregated neighborhoods.

This is why Redfin’s mission to redefine real estate in your favor has long included a special commitment to our customers of color. At Redfin’s 2020 kickoff meeting, we trained our agents and lenders on racism in real estate. In 2019, we successfully campaigned to eliminate pocket listings that can prevent minority homebuyers from seeing the most desirable homes for sale.

In 2018, we hosted an industry event on racism featuring our agents, customers and academics. We’ve supported controversial business taxes to fund more housing, and controversial zoning for more integrated neighborhoods. The representation of people of color in our workforce has increased from 34% in 2018 to 35% in 2019 to 36% in 2020; it’s now more than double the industry average.

But after George Floyd’s death, we came to a reckoning that our efforts haven’t been enough. Redfin decided last week to base a significant portion of next year’s executive bonuses on goals to increase the company’s overall diversity, and the diversity of our executives and board members. By the end of 2020, Redfin’s leaders have committed the first funding for a million-dollar-plus philanthropic effort to increase housing access for low-income or under-served communities.

This summer, we’re extending inclusive-management training from our brokerage’s managers to all our managers. And we’re exploring how we can keep broadening the range of lower-income neighborhoods and rural towns we serve."

— Glenn Kelman, CEO of Redfin
