There is much to do to right societyâ€™s long history of wrongs against Black communities. We can put out statements all day, but we know that words alone can feel quaint. Real, meaningful work is necessary to create change. Together with the BSA, we will continue to do that work.

We stand with our Black employees, our customers, and the Black community in demanding an end to systemic racism and police brutality.
